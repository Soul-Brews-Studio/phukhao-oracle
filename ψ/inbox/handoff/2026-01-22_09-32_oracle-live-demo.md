# Handoff: Oracle-Live Demo Session

**Date**: 2026-01-22 09:32
**Context**: Demo of /forward skill after running /oracle-live play

## What We Did

- Ran `/recap --rich` for full session orientation
- Executed `/oracle-live play` — full 4-beat presentation with slides
- Learned: keep output minimal during live presentation (no tables for audience)
- Created this handoff as demo of the /forward skill

## Pending

- [ ] Commit statusline.json changes

## Next Session

- [ ] After event: create retrospective with `/rrr`
- [ ] Document audience reactions and "ขนลุก" moments
- [ ] Consider updating /oracle-live skill to have cleaner output

## Key Files

- `.claude/skills/oracle-live/SKILL.md` — presentation skill
- `ψ/memory/logs/oracle-live/block-mountain-2026/` — slides + audio
