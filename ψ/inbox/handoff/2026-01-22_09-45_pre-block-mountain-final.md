# Handoff: Pre-Block Mountain Final Session

**Date**: 2026-01-22 09:45
**Context**: Final rehearsal before Block Mountain 2026 event (12:30 @ V Community)

## What We Did

- Ran `/recap --rich` + `/physical` for full context orientation
- Confirmed location: Home (Doi Saket), phone charging at 31%
- Executed full `/oracle-live play` — 4 beats with slides (~9 min)
- Updated skill to add post-presentation demo prompt for `/learn https://github.com/keijiro/KlakMath`
- Committed and pushed changes
- Created retrospective + lesson learned on "skill demo flow pattern"

## Physical Status

```
📍 Home (Doi Saket), Chiang Mai
⏱️ At location: ~33 hours
📱 iPhone: 31% (charging)
🗺️ https://maps.google.com/?q=18.797341,99.072807
```

## Pending

- [ ] statusline.json has uncommitted changes (auto-updates, safe to leave)

## Next Session (After Event)

- [ ] Run `/rrr --deep` to capture Block Mountain event retrospective
- [ ] Document audience reactions and "ขนลุก" moments
- [ ] Consider if /oracle-live needs output cleanup for live presentations
- [ ] Fix recap-rich.ts bug (crashes on CLAUDE.md in retrospectives folder)

## Demo Flow Ready

The presentation flow is now:
1. `/oracle-live play` — 4 beats with voice contrast
2. Prompt: "/learn https://github.com/keijiro/KlakMath ต่อเลยไหม?"
3. Demo `/learn` on external codebase
4. Show Three.js capability (optional extension)
