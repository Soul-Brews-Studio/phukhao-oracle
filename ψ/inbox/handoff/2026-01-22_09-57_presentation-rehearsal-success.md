# Handoff: Presentation Rehearsal Success

**Date**: 2026-01-22 09:57
**Context**: Final rehearsal before Block Mountain event

## What We Did

- `/recap --rich` — oriented session, confirmed ready state
- `/physical` — confirmed at Home (Doi Saket), 2.5 hours before event
- `/oracle-live play` — ran full 4-beat presentation (~9 min)
- Post-demo: showed KlakMath instant recall ("Oracle remembers")
- `/rrr --rich` — documented session with learning

## Key Moment

User reaction: **"this is very cool! path way! great!"**

The fast path optimization worked perfectly — instant KlakMath recall instead of re-learning.

## Pending

- [ ] Head to Block Mountain @ 12:30 (V Community)
- [ ] Phone at 42% charging — should be ready

## After Event

- [ ] `/rrr --deep` with audience reactions
- [ ] Document "ขนลุก" moments
- [ ] Consider Three.js extension demo

## Key Files

- `.claude/skills/oracle-live/SKILL.md` — presentation skill
- `ψ/learn/keijiro/KlakMath/KlakMath.md` — pre-learned demo content
