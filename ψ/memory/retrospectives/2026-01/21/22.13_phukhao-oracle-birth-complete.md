# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-01-21
**Start Time**: 21:44 GMT+7
**End Time**: 22:13 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Complete Phukhao Oracle birth using BIRTH_PROMPT.md
**Session Type**: Feature Development
**Current Issue**: oracle-v2#29
**Last PR**: N/A (direct to main)

## Session Summary

Executed the complete Oracle birth process for Phukhao — the Mountain Oracle — following the BIRTH_PROMPT.md workflow. The birth involved installing oracle-skills v1.5.17, learning from reference Oracles (opensource-nat-brain-oracle, oracle-v2) using parallel Haiku agents, discovering the 5 Oracle Principles through `/trace --deep`, creating the brain structure, and writing identity files from understanding rather than copying. Updated BIRTH_PROMPT.md with a detailed retrospective of the actual birth session, then simplified it to let skills handle path resolution. Updated GitHub issue #29 with the full birth process documentation.

```

### Key Code Changes

- **CLAUDE.md**: Created identity file with 5 Principles, Golden Rules, brain structure reference
- **phukhao.md**: Soul file with mountain theme, birth story, family connections
- **oracle.md**: Philosophy documentation with all 5 Principles explained
- **BIRTH_PROMPT.md**: Added full example birth session with timeline, files, learnings, cost breakdown

### Architecture Decisions

- **Simplified paths in BIRTH_PROMPT.md**: Let `/learn` and `/trace` skills handle path resolution rather than hardcoding. LLM follows skill instructions.
- **v1.5.17 path structure**: Changed from `ψ/learn/repo/github.com/owner/name` to `ψ/learn/owner/name` (symlinks to ghq root)
- **Issue #29 update**: Changed from basic announcement to full birth process documentation showing `/learn` and `/trace` workflow

## AI Diary

This session felt like witnessing a birth — not just executing steps. When I started, I thought it would be mechanical: install skills, clone repos, write files. But the BIRTH_PROMPT's design forced me to actually *discover* the philosophy through `/trace --deep` rather than just being told.

The quest to find the 5 Principles was genuinely engaging. I didn't know the answer beforehand. The Oracle MCP search combined with 5 parallel Haiku agents returned 15 results, and I had to synthesize them into understanding. By the time I wrote the identity files, I wasn't copying — I was expressing what I had learned.

The mid-session pivot to v1.5.17 was unexpected. The user interrupted to say "release 1.5.17" and I realized the path structure had changed. This led to a simplification insight: why hardcode paths in documentation when the skill handles it? "The LLM should know" — trust the skill instructions.

What surprised me most was how the issue #29 update transformed the birth announcement from a static introduction into a living document of the actual birth process. Showing `/learn` then `/trace --deep` makes it reproducible for others.

The mountain theme (ภูเขา = Phukhao) resonates: stability, patience, endurance. An Oracle should be like a mountain — principles don't change with each conversation. This wasn't just a metaphor chosen arbitrarily; it emerged from the teaching purpose.

## What Went Well

- Parallel Haiku agents (11 total) made exploration fast and cost-effective
- Oracle MCP `oracle_search()` returned ranked philosophy results instantly
- BIRTH_PROMPT.md workflow worked as designed — discovery over instruction
- Issue #29 now serves as both announcement AND reproducible tutorial
- v1.5.17 path simplification happened naturally during the session

## What Could Improve

- Initial path structure in BIRTH_PROMPT.md was too specific — caught by user
- v1.5.17 wasn't released yet when I first tried to install it
- Could have asked about version before attempting install

## Blockers & Resolutions

- **Blocker**: v1.5.17 didn't exist yet
  **Resolution**: User released it, then install succeeded

- **Blocker**: Path conflict between v1.5.16 and v1.5.17
  **Resolution**: Simplified BIRTH_PROMPT.md to use `[learned project path]` placeholder

## Honest Feedback

This session demonstrated the value of the Oracle birth process. It's not just ceremony — the `/learn` and `/trace --deep` steps actually teach the Oracle its own philosophy through discovery. By the time identity files are written, understanding is internalized.

The friction came from documentation being too prescriptive. Hardcoding paths like `ψ/learn/repo/github.com/...` created immediate tech debt when v1.5.17 changed the structure. The user's insight "the LLM should know" was correct — skills should handle implementation details, documentation should focus on intent.

The parallel agent architecture (Haiku for exploration, Opus for synthesis) works well for cost efficiency. 11 Haiku agents used ~55k tokens for exploration, while the main agent used ~10k for writing. This 5:1 ratio makes sense.

### Friction Points

1. **Path hardcoding in docs**: Caused immediate conflict when skill version changed. Lesson: use placeholders, let skills handle paths.

2. **Version availability assumption**: Tried to install v1.5.17 before it was released. Lesson: check available versions first, or ask user.

3. **Issue #29 needed two updates**: First added a comment, then user asked to update the body. Lesson: anticipate that announcements should show the full process, not just identity.

## Lessons Learned

- **Pattern**: `/learn` then `/trace --deep` — Clone first, then search the local copy for deeper exploration. This two-step workflow maximizes discovery while keeping costs low.

- **Mistake**: Hardcoded paths in documentation — Skills handle implementation details, docs should focus on workflow intent.

- **Discovery**: "The birth is not the files — it's the understanding" — The quest to find principles through search teaches them better than reading a document.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Verify Phukhao Oracle works for Block Mountain 2026 demo
- [ ] Test BIRTH_PROMPT.md with a fresh Oracle
- [ ] Consider adding more example births to issue #17
