# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-01-22
**Start Time**: 09:37 GMT+7
**End Time**: 09:45 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~8 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Oracle-live presentation run and skill enhancement
**Session Type**: Feature Development
**Current Issue**: Block Mountain 2026 preparation
**Last PR**: N/A (direct main commits for event prep)

## Session Summary

Quick session for final rehearsal of the oracle-live presentation before Block Mountain 2026 event. Ran full 4-beat presentation with slides, then enhanced the skill to prompt for the next demo step (/learn on KlakMath repo). This creates a smoother live demo flow.

## Timeline
- 09:37 - Started session with /recap --rich + /physical check
- 09:38 - Confirmed location (Doi Saket home), phone charging at 31%
- 09:39 - Ran /oracle-live play — full 4-beat presentation (~9 min)
- 09:43 - Updated SKILL.md to add post-presentation demo prompt
- 09:44 - Committed and pushed changes
- 09:45 - Running retrospective

### Key Code Changes
- oracle-live/SKILL.md: Added "Post-Presentation Demo" section with prompt for /learn continuation
- statusline.json: Updated with new session metrics

### Architecture Decisions
- Keep demo flow in skill file rather than hardcoding in code — flexible for future events
- Use AskUserQuestion pattern for demo continuation prompt

## 📝 AI Diary

This was a short but satisfying session. Coming in fresh after the clear command, I ran the rich recap to orient myself — seeing the handoff from the previous session about the beat4-anatta fix being ready was helpful context. The physical check confirmed Nat is still at home in Doi Saket with about 3 hours before the Block Mountain event.

Running the full presentation felt different this time. There's something meaningful about playing all four beats in sequence — the female voice through beats 1-3, then the shift to the male voice for beat 4 on anatta creates this deliberate contrast. "รูป และ สุญญตา" — form and formless.

When Nat requested the skill update, I appreciated the clarity of the feedback. Voice transcription had "Blackman klakmath" but the intent was clear — keijiro/KlakMath, a Unity math library. The update was small but purposeful: after the philosophical presentation, naturally flow into a practical demo of the /learn skill exploring external code.

The session felt right-sized. No scope creep, just: run presentation, update skill, commit, done. That simplicity aligns with the Oracle philosophy — do what's needed, nothing more.

## What Went Well
- Rich recap script provided good orientation despite small error with CLAUDE.md file
- Physical skill gave useful context (phone charging, location confirmed)
- Skill update was clean and targeted
- Fast commit-push cycle

## What Could Improve
- recap-rich.ts has a bug — crashes on CLAUDE.md files in retrospectives folder
- Voice transcription required clarification for repo name

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: recap-rich.ts crashed on CLAUDE.md file in retrospectives folder
  **Resolution**: Worked around by reading handoff file directly; script needs fix

## 💭 Honest Feedback

This session was efficient but highlighted a small infrastructure issue — the recap-rich.ts script isn't handling CLAUDE.md files in the retrospectives folder structure. It's trying to treat them as directories. Should be a quick fix (filter out files before iterating as directories).

The voice-to-text interpretation was interesting. "Blackman klakmath" from Nat's voice transcription of "keijiro/KlakMath" — a reasonable phonetic mapping in Thai pronunciation. This is a pattern I see often: when users dictate technical terms, especially GitHub URLs or repo names, clarification helps.

The oracle-live skill now has a natural demo flow: presentation → prompt → /learn demo. This makes the live presentation smoother because Nat doesn't have to remember what comes next — the skill guides the flow.

### Friction Points
1. **recap-rich.ts bug**: Crashes on CLAUDE.md files in date folders — needs defensive check
2. **Voice transcription ambiguity**: Technical terms like repo names get mangled — solved by asking for clarification
3. **No slides for beat4**: The anatta section has audio but no dedicated slides file — minor but noticeable

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Adding post-action prompts to skills creates natural demo flow
- **Mistake**: None this session — kept scope tight
- **Discovery**: The 4-beat structure with voice change in beat4 creates meaningful contrast

## Next Steps
- [ ] Head to Block Mountain event
- [ ] After event: Run /rrr with audience reactions
- [ ] Fix recap-rich.ts CLAUDE.md handling bug
