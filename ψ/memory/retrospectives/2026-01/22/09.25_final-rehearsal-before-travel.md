## Session Summary

Quick session to run the full Block Mountain presentation one final time before Nat heads to V Community. Ran `/recap --deep` for orientation, then `/oracle-live play` to verify slides and all 3 audio beats work correctly. Created forward handoff for post-event resumption.

## What Went Well

1. **Full presentation verified** — Slides opened, all 3 audio beats playing
2. **Quick orientation** — /recap --deep provided full context efficiently
3. **Clean handoff created** — Post-event work clearly documented

## What Could Improve

1. **Recap scripts still missing** — Fell back to manual git commands again
2. **Audio playback blocking** — Had to continue while audio plays in background

## Lessons Learned

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Final run-through** | Always test full presentation before travel |
| **Handoff discipline** | Create handoff even for short sessions |
