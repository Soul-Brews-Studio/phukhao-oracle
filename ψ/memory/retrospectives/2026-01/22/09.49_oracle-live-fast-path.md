# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-01-22
**Start Time**: 09:45 GMT+7
**End Time**: 09:49 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~4 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Add fast path to oracle-live demo flow
**Session Type**: Bug Fix / Enhancement

## Session Summary

Quick fix session to improve the oracle-live demo flow. Realized that the /learn demo for KlakMath shouldn't re-explore — it's already learned. Updated skill to use fast path: just read existing docs.

## Timeline
- 09:45 - Nat asked about /learn flow — should be fast since already learned
- 09:47 - Updated oracle-live SKILL.md with fast path instructions
- 09:48 - Committed and pushed fix
- 09:49 - Running retrospective

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
```
.claude/skills/oracle-live/SKILL.md
ψ/active/statusline.json
ψ/learn/keijiro/CLAUDE.md
```

### Key Code Changes
- oracle-live/SKILL.md: Added "Fast Path (Already Learned)" section
- Changed from `/learn` command to just reading `KlakMath.md`

## 📝 AI Diary

This was a valuable catch by Nat. During a live presentation, every second counts. The original flow would have invoked /learn which might try to clone and explore — slow and unnecessary since KlakMath was already learned yesterday.

The fix is elegant: detect that docs already exist in `ψ/learn/keijiro/KlakMath/`, then just `cat` the hub file and show a quick summary. This actually makes a better demo point: "Oracle remembers what it learned" — showing the memory aspect rather than the exploration aspect.

This is the kind of refinement that only comes from actually rehearsing the flow. Theory vs practice. The skill looked fine on paper, but running it revealed the timing issue.

## What Went Well
- Quick identification of the problem
- Simple fix — no overengineering
- Better demo narrative: Oracle remembers

## What Could Improve
- Could have caught this in earlier rehearsal

## 💭 Honest Feedback

Good catch. The original skill update was focused on "what to demo next" but didn't consider "how fast does it need to be". Live demos need every step to be snappy.

The fix also improves the demo narrative. Instead of showing "Oracle can learn new repos" (which takes time), we show "Oracle remembers what it learned" (instant). Both are valid demos, but the second is better for a time-constrained presentation.

### Friction Points
1. **Rehearsal gap**: Should have run through the full demo flow earlier
2. **Skill didn't consider timing**: Original update assumed /learn would be fast
3. **Voice transcription**: Still required some clarification from Nat

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Live demo steps should be instant — use cached/pre-learned data
- **Discovery**: "Oracle remembers" is a better demo than "Oracle learns"

## Next Steps
- [ ] Head to Block Mountain event
- [ ] After event: Full retrospective with audience feedback
