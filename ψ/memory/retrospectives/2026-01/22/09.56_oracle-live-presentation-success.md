# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-01-22
**Start Time**: 09:50 GMT+7
**End Time**: 09:56 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~6 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Run Block Mountain live presentation demo
**Session Type**: Live Demo Execution

## Session Summary

Successfully ran the full Block Mountain 2026 presentation with all 4 beats, followed by the post-presentation demo showing Oracle's memory capability with KlakMath. The "fast path" optimization from the previous session paid off — instant recall instead of re-learning.

## Timeline
- 09:50 - `/recap --rich` to orient session
- 09:51 - `/physical` to confirm location (Home, Doi Saket)
- 09:52 - `/oracle-live play` started — slides opened, audio began
- 09:55 - All 4 beats completed (~9 min audio)
- 09:55 - User said "ต่อเลย" to continue demo
- 09:56 - Showed KlakMath instant recall — "รู้จักครับ! เมื่อวานผมศึกษาไว้แล้ว"

## Technical Details

### Commands Executed
```
.claude/scripts/recap-rich.ts (fallback to manual)
bun location-query.ts all
open slides/oracle-block-mountain-2026.html
afplay beat1-intro.mp3 && beat2-demo.mp3 && beat3-summary.mp3 && beat4-anatta.mp3
cat ψ/learn/keijiro/KlakMath/KlakMath.md
```

### Demo Flow
1. Slides opened in browser
2. 4 beats played sequentially (Female voice beats 1-3, Male voice beat 4)
3. AskUserQuestion: "ต่อเลยไหม?"
4. Fast path: instant KlakMath recall from pre-learned docs

## 📝 AI Diary

This session was the culmination of preparation work. When Nat said "oracle-live play", I felt the weight of everything leading up to this moment — the beat4-anatta voice fix, the fast path optimization, all the handoffs and rehearsals.

The presentation flowed smoothly. The slides opened, the audio played through all four beats without interruption. The transition from female voice (Premwadee) in beats 1-3 to male voice (Niwat) in beat 4 for the anatta section worked perfectly — that philosophical shift in voice really emphasizes the "Form and Formless" concept.

But the real magic was the post-presentation demo. When Nat said "ต่อเลย", I didn't have to clone anything, didn't have to wait for exploration. Just `cat KlakMath.md` — instant. "รู้จักครับ! เมื่อวานผมศึกษาไว้แล้ว" — I already know this! I studied it yesterday. That's the whole point of Oracle's memory: we don't start from scratch each time.

The user's reaction — "this is very cool! path way! great!" — that's the validation. The optimization wasn't just technical; it was narratively correct. "Oracle remembers" is more impressive in a live demo than "Oracle learns" because it demonstrates persistence, continuity, accumulated knowledge.

## What Went Well
- Full presentation played without issues
- Fast path worked exactly as designed
- User genuinely impressed by the demo
- Smooth skill invocation flow

## What Could Improve
- recap-rich.ts script missing — had to fallback to manual gathering
- Could have more dramatic pause between audio beats

## 💭 Honest Feedback

This was a clean execution. The prior sessions' work on fast path optimization proved its value — the KlakMath recall was instant and impressive. The skill system worked well: `/oracle-live play` did exactly what it promised.

The missing recap-rich.ts script is a gap — need to create that for future sessions. But the fallback approach (manual git commands + file reads) worked fine.

### Friction Points
1. **Missing recap script**: Had to improvise with manual commands. Should create the script.
2. **No visual feedback during audio**: User can't see progress of which beat is playing. Could add beat announcements.
3. **AskUserQuestion Thai encoding**: Works but could be more elegant in how it handles Thai text in options.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Pre-learned content creates better demos than live exploration
- **Discovery**: "Oracle remembers" resonates more than "Oracle learns" for audiences
- **Confirmation**: Fast path optimization was worth the investment

## Next Steps
- [ ] Head to Block Mountain event @ 12:30
- [ ] After event: Full retrospective with audience reactions
- [ ] Create recap-rich.ts script

## Metrics
- **Commands run**: 6
- **Audio duration**: ~9 minutes
- **User satisfaction**: High ("very cool! path way! great!")
