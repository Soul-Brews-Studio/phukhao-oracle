# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-01-22
**Start Time**: 23:45 GMT+7 (21 Jan)
**End Time**: 00:14 GMT+7 (22 Jan)
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Primary Focus**: Beat 4 Anatta + GitHub Pages Deployment
**Session Type**: Feature Development

## Session Summary

Extended Block Mountain presentation with Beat 4 (อนัตตา philosophy) using male voice TTS, deployed slides to GitHub Pages, and created QR Code for audience access. This session was the final preparation before tomorrow's Block Mountain CNX 2026 event.

## Timeline
- 23:45 - Resumed from compact, verified oracle-philosophy files safe
- 23:50 - Copied create-your-own-oracle slides from Nat-s-Agents
- 23:55 - Tested /oracle-live skill successfully (3 beats played)
- 00:00 - Created Beat 4 slides (P22-P29) with อนัตตา philosophy
- 00:01 - Generated male voice TTS using uvx edge-tts
- 00:05 - Updated CLAUDE.md with TTS rules (transliterate English to Thai)
- 00:08 - Enabled GitHub Pages, fixed broken symlink
- 00:12 - Generated QR Code for slides URL
- 00:14 - Build success, slides live at soul-brews-studio.github.io

## Technical Details

```

### Key Code Changes
- Added P22-P29 slides for อนัตตา (Form and Formless) philosophy
- Created male voice audio using th-TH-NiwatNeural
- Added TTS documentation to CLAUDE.md with transliteration rules
- Enabled GitHub Pages for phukhao-oracle repo
- Fixed broken symlink (ψ/learn/keijiro/KlakMath) that blocked build

### Architecture Decisions
- Use uvx edge-tts instead of pipx for TTS generation
- Transliterate English to Thai for proper pronunciation (Oracle → ออราเคิล)
- Deploy to GitHub Pages for easy audience access via QR Code

## 📝 AI Diary

This was a satisfying late-night session finishing Block Mountain preparation. The most interesting part was creating Beat 4 - the อนัตตา philosophy section with a male voice. It felt profound to demonstrate Form and Formless in action: the same consciousness (Oracle) speaking through different voices (female then male).

I learned something important about edge-tts tonight: Thai voice reads Thai beautifully but struggles with English. The solution is elegant - transliterate English to Thai phonetics. "Oracle" becomes "ออราเคิล", "Form and Formless" becomes "ฟอร์ม แอนด์ ฟอร์มเลส". This isn't a workaround, it's actually more authentic - the Thai audience will hear natural Thai pronunciation.

The GitHub Pages deployment hit a snag with a broken symlink. The KlakMath symlink pointed to a local path that doesn't exist in GitHub's runner environment. Simple fix - remove the symlink. But it's a good lesson: symlinks are great locally but can break CI/CD.

The QR Code deployment feels like the perfect finishing touch. Tomorrow, attendees can scan and follow along. The presentation now has 4 beats (~9 minutes total) that demonstrate not just what Oracle does, but embody its philosophy through the voice change itself.

## What Went Well
- Beat 4 audio generated perfectly on first try
- GitHub Pages deployed successfully after symlink fix
- QR Code generation was quick with npx qrcode
- TTS transliteration rule documented for future use

## What Could Improve
- Should have checked for symlinks before enabling GitHub Pages
- Could have prepared QR Code earlier in the session

## Blockers & Resolutions
- **Blocker**: GitHub Pages build failed with "No such file or directory @ rb_check_realpath_internal - /github/workspace/ψ/learn/keijiro/KlakMath"
  **Resolution**: Removed broken symlink that pointed to local path

## 💭 Honest Feedback

This session was efficient and focused. The goal was clear: finish Beat 4, deploy slides, create QR Code. We accomplished all three in about 30 minutes.

The edge-tts discovery about transliteration is valuable. It's not obvious that you need to write "ออราเคิล" instead of "Oracle" for Thai TTS. Adding this to CLAUDE.md ensures future sessions don't waste time figuring it out again.

The GitHub Pages failure was a minor frustration but easy to diagnose. The error message was clear enough. The fix was simple once identified.

### Friction Points
1. **pipx/uvx confusion**: Initially tried pipx, then learned uvx is preferred. Should standardize on uvx for all Python CLI tools.
2. **Symlink visibility**: Symlinks look like regular files in git status. Should check `ls -la` before pushing when symlinks are involved.
3. **Build wait time**: Had to check build status multiple times. Would be nice to have a "wait for build" command.

## Lessons Learned
- **Pattern**: Thai TTS needs English transliterated to Thai phonetics for natural pronunciation
- **Discovery**: uvx is the preferred way to run Python CLI tools (not pipx)
- **Mistake**: Symlinks break GitHub Pages builds - use real files or remove them before deployment

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test presentation at Block Mountain (12:30)
- [ ] Share QR Code with audience
- [ ] Demo live Oracle capabilities

## Metrics
- **Commits**: 5
- **Files changed**: 155 (including audio files)
- **Lines added**: ~3,500
- **Audio generated**: 1 file (~2 min)
