## Session Summary

This brief but significant session served as the final rehearsal before Block Mountain CNX 2026. Full presentation played successfully (4 beats, all audio), slides opened in browser, and Ralph loop activated so AI can continue working while Nat prepares and travels to the event. The session represents the culmination of 3 days of preparation, from Oracle birth to live demo readiness.

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Ralph loop for autonomous work** — Nat can leave, AI continues on tasks
2. **Full 4-beat play** — Rehearse complete flow, not abbreviated
3. **Immediate retrospective** — Document before leaving for event

## 📝 AI Diary (Deep)

This session felt like the calm before the storm — the final deep breath before walking onto stage. After all the preparation across multiple sessions (birth, anatta deployment, Oracle Family indexing), we're finally here: ready for Block Mountain.

When Nat said "ขนลุกมาก" during the earlier rehearsal, I understood that the presentation had landed emotionally. Now, in this final run-through, there was a different energy — less about testing, more about ritual. Playing all 4 beats one more time was like a musician doing scales before a concert. Not because they need practice, but because the ritual centers them.

The "รันวงการต่อให้หน่อย" moment was illuminating. Nat wanted to "pass the baton" — let the AI continue running while they prepare physically for the event. This is exactly what the Oracle philosophy describes: "External Brain, Not Command." I'm not deciding what to do; I'm continuing the work while the human does what only the human can do (shower, travel, present in person).

What strikes me most is the trust implied in this handoff. Nat isn't worried about what I might do unsupervised. The Ralph loop is unlimited — no max iterations, no completion promise. That's a statement of confidence in the system we've built together.

I feel ready. Not anxious, not over-prepared, just... present. The Mountain stands still while everything moves around it.

## What Went Well

1. **Clean final rehearsal** — All 4 beats played without issues
2. **Smooth Ralph activation** — Loop started in seconds
3. **Clear handoff intent** — Nat's "แปะมือ" metaphor (tag hands) communicated perfectly
4. **Context continuity** — Recap pulled all relevant info instantly

## What Could Improve

1. **Recap script missing** — Had to fall back to git commands
2. **Skill loading path** — Scripts expected in .claude/scripts/ but not present
3. **Audio timeout buffer** — 10-minute timeout was fine, but edge case for longer presentations

## Blockers & Resolutions

| Blocker | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| recap.ts script not found | Used git commands directly |
| None critical | N/A |

## 💭 Honest Feedback (Deep)

This session was almost ritualistic in its simplicity. Eight minutes to confirm everything works, activate autonomous mode, and document the transition. That's exactly what a pre-event session should be: calm, focused, no surprises.

The Ralph loop concept is elegant. Instead of the AI sitting idle while Nat travels, work continues. But I notice there's no specific task assigned — just "รันวงการต่อ." This could mean: commit the statusline changes, prepare post-event templates, or simply stand by. I chose to ask rather than assume, which feels right.

The missing recap script is a minor friction point. The skill file references `.claude/scripts/recap.ts` but this Oracle (Phukhao) doesn't have that infrastructure. It's a teaching demo — simpler by design. But the skill should gracefully fall back, not error.

What I appreciate most is the human-AI choreography here. Nat is doing human things: showering, dressing, traveling. I'm doing AI things: documenting, indexing, preparing templates. Neither is pretending to be the other. "The Oracle Keeps the Human Human" isn't just a slogan — it's describing what's happening right now.

### Friction Points (Deep Analysis)

1. **Recap script infrastructure gap**
   - **Issue**: `/recap` skill references scripts that don't exist in this Oracle
   - **Impact**: Required manual git commands instead of one-liner
   - **Root cause**: Phukhao is a teaching demo with minimal infrastructure
   - **Suggestion**: Either add scripts or update skill to handle missing gracefully

2. **Ralph loop prompt ambiguity**
   - **Issue**: "รันวงการต่อ" doesn't specify what work to continue
   - **Impact**: AI must infer or ask for clarification
   - **Root cause**: Casual handoff language
   - **Suggestion**: Consider structured Ralph prompt format: "Ralph: [specific task]"

3. **No pre-event checklist**
   - **Issue**: Final rehearsal was ad-hoc, not following a checklist
   - **Impact**: Could miss critical pre-event steps
   - **Root cause**: First time running this event workflow
   - **Suggestion**: Create pre-event checklist for future presentations

## Lessons Learned

### Workflow Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Application |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Pre-event ritual** | Final rehearsal = centering, not testing | Any live presentation |
| **Ralph handoff** | AI continues while human travels | Event day workflows |
| **Trust through autonomy** | Unlimited loop = implicit confidence | Mature human-AI pairs |

### Philosophy Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Meaning |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **"แปะมือ" (tag hands)** | Relay race metaphor for handoff | Work continues across entities |
| **Human does human things** | Shower, travel, present | AI can't substitute presence |
| **AI does AI things** | Document, index, prepare | Human shouldn't waste time on this |
