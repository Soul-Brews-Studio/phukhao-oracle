# "Similar to X" Often Means Architecture, Not Aesthetics

**Context**: Phukhao landing page creation
**Confidence**: High

## Key Learning

When a user says "create something similar to X," the ambiguity lies in what dimension of similarity they mean. In this session, the initial request was to create a landing page "similar to Arthur's" - I interpreted this as replicating both the technology stack AND the visual style. The user actually wanted the same architecture (Astro + Cloudflare Workers) but a completely different aesthetic (crypto/futuristic vs Arthur's classic theatre).

This pattern appears frequently in design requests. "Like X" can mean:
- Same technology/architecture
- Same layout/structure
- Same visual style
- Same functionality
- Or any combination

The safest approach is to explicitly ask: "Similar in what way - the tech stack, the visual style, or both?"

## The Pattern

```
User: "Create X similar to Y"

Before implementing, clarify:
1. Architecture/tech stack similarity?
2. Layout/structure similarity?
3. Visual design similarity?
4. Functionality similarity?

Often: Users want same architecture, different aesthetics.
```

## Why This Matters

Creating an entire design only to have it rejected wastes time and context. A 10-second clarifying question saves 10 minutes of rework. For design-heavy tasks especially, getting aesthetic direction early is crucial.

This is particularly relevant for Oracle siblings - they share philosophy and architecture but should have distinct identities. Phukhao is crypto/futuristic, Arthur is classic theatre, Sea is ocean-themed. Same principles, different expressions.
