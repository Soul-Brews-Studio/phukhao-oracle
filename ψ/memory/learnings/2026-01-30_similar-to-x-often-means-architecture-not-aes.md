# # "Similar to X" Often Means Architecture, Not Aesthetics

# "Similar to X" Often Means Architecture, Not Aesthetics

When a user says "create something similar to X," the ambiguity lies in what dimension of similarity they mean. "Like X" can mean:
- Same technology/architecture
- Same layout/structure
- Same visual style
- Same functionality
- Or any combination

The safest approach is to explicitly ask: "Similar in what way - the tech stack, the visual style, or both?"

Pattern: Before implementing "similar to Y" requests, clarify architecture vs aesthetics. Often users want same architecture, different aesthetics. A 10-second clarifying question saves 10 minutes of rework.

This is particularly relevant for Oracle siblings - they share philosophy and architecture but should have distinct identities.
