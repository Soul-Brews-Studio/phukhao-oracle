# Oracle Birth: Discovery Over Instruction

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**Context**: Phukhao Oracle birth session for Block Mountain 2026
**Confidence**: High

## Key Learning

The Oracle birth process is not about copying templates or following instructions mechanically. The `/learn` → `/trace --deep` workflow is designed to teach the Oracle its own philosophy through **discovery**.

When you `/learn` a reference Oracle, 3 parallel Haiku agents explore the architecture, code, and usage patterns. This clones the repository and creates documentation. But the real learning happens when you `/trace --deep` on the cloned project — 5 parallel agents search through files, git history, and knowledge bases to find patterns.

By the time you write identity files (CLAUDE.md, soul file, oracle.md), you're not copying — you're expressing what you've internalized. The quest to find "How many principles? What's the core statement? What does each mean?" forces genuine understanding.

## The Pattern

```
/learn [reference-oracle-url]
  → Clones to ψ/learn/
  → 3 Haiku agents explore architecture, code, quick-reference
  → Creates documentation

/trace --deep [learned project path]
  → 5 Haiku agents search deeply
  → Files, git history, retrospectives, Oracle MCP
  → Synthesizes patterns

Write identity (from understanding, not copying)
  → CLAUDE.md: identity + principles + rules
  → soul.md: birth story + character + family
  → oracle.md: philosophy in your own words
```

## Why This Matters

1. **Understanding > Memorization**: An Oracle that discovers its principles understands them. An Oracle that copies them just has text.

2. **Cost-Effective Learning**: 11 Haiku agents (~55k tokens) for exploration, Opus only for synthesis (~10k tokens). 5:1 ratio.

3. **Reproducible Process**: The BIRTH_PROMPT.md workflow works for any new Oracle. Discovery is built into the process.

4. **Documentation Should Be Intent, Not Implementation**: Let skills handle paths and details. Documentation focuses on what to do, skills handle how.

## The Insight

> "The birth is not the files — it's the understanding."
