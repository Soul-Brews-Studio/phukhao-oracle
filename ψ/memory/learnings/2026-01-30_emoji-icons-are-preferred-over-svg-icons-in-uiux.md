# Emoji icons are preferred over SVG icons in UI/UX work. Reason: LLMs cannot crea

Emoji icons are preferred over SVG icons in UI/UX work. Reason: LLMs cannot create consistent SVG icons - they vary each time. Emojis are universal, consistent across generations, and require no design skills. When building landing pages or UIs, use emoji (🏔️, 🍺, ⚡, etc.) instead of attempting custom SVG icons.
